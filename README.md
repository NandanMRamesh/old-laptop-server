My Journey turning an old laptop into a self-hosted server.
# Old Laptop ‚Üí Home Server (Ubuntu Server + Docker)

Repurposed an HP Laptop 15-bs series into a small home server.  
Current scope: headless Ubuntu Server, wired-only networking, Docker runtime, safe power behavior (no sleep on lid close), and automatic screen blanking after inactivity.

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs implemented

- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS installed
- OpenSSH server enabled for remote admin
- Docker Engine installed and verified
- Wired Ethernet as the only network path (Wi-Fi disabled to avoid instability)
- ‚ÄúLid closed‚Äù does **not** suspend/shutdown
- Screen blanks after 5 minutes of inactivity (server keeps running)

---

## Hardware / Network

- **Host:** HP Laptop 15-bs series, Intel i3, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD
- **Network:** LAN via Ethernet (interface: `eno1`)
- **Router:** DHCP reservation used so the server keeps the same IP (e.g., `192.168.1.12`)
